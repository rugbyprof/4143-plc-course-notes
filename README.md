Decisions

- Read OOP_concepts first
- Jump around and create a master topics list. This is done and not yet implemented because we are focusing on the content. Can easily be done.
-  Going to convert everything from markdown to latex in a big batch when we are done completely building out the sections/chapters. Building a script shouldn't be a big deal. Once in the doc it will follow out formatting conventions according to the latex doc main formatting. 


Completed:
-  Chapters 1, 2, 3 and 7.
