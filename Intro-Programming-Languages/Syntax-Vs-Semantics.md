# **Syntax** and **Semantics** 
  are both fundamental concepts in programming languages. They define how code is structured (syntax) and what that code means (semantics). 

**Syntax:**

Syntax is all about the structure and rules that govern how you write code in a programming language. It's like the grammar of the language. If you violate syntax rules, your code won't even compile. Syntax varies greatly across the many programming languages to fullfill various language goals/requirements. 
  
  Some example of syntax, 

    int x = 5; C++
    x = 5      Python
    x := 5     Golang
    int x = 5; C#

Most programming languages syntax are defined to be a familiar feel for programmers. Seeing the 4 different programming languages above you can see a common trend for declaring integer data types both statically and dynamically. 


### Let's break them down with examples in Go:

here's an easy example of Go code that follows syntax rules:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

In this code, the syntax includes rules like using curly braces `{}` to define blocks of code, using parentheses `()` for function parameters, the "." operator for accessing a modules function, and so on. If you make a syntax error, such as forgetting to close a parenthesis, your code won't compile.

**Semantics:**

Semantics, on the other hand, is about the meaning of your code. Even if your code follows all the syntax rules, it can still produce incorrect or unexpected results if the semantics are flawed. Trying to divide two floating point numbers while they are initialized as integers can be another semantically incorrect example.

Here's an easy example in Golang:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    x := 5
    y := "5"
    result := x + y
    fmt.Println(result)
}
```

This code follows the syntax rules perfectly, but it has a semantic error. The variable `x` is an integer, and `y` is a string, so you can't add them together. This will result in a runtime error but will still compile with the errors. 

```
invalid operation: x + y (mismatched types int and string)
```

So, to fix the semantics, you would need to convert one of the variables to match the type of the other:

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "strconv"

func main() {
	x := 5
	y := "5"

	integer_y, _ := strconv.Atoi(y)
	result := x + integer_y

	fmt.Println(result)
}

```

In this revised code, we use `strconv.Atoi` to convert the string `y` into an integer before adding it to `x`. This now has 'correct' semantics.

  syntax is like the grammar of a programming language - it enforces the rules for how you must write code, while semantics is about the meaning of your code and whether it does what you intend it to do. Both syntax and semantics are crucial for writing reliable and functional software. You must first learn the syntax to write semantically correct code. You can't have good semantics without proper syntax usage.
