# Chapter 3: Expressions and Their Evaluation

In this chapter, we dive into the world of expressions and learn how they are evaluated in a programming language using examples in golang.

## 3.1 Expressions and Their Evaluation

In this section, we introduce the concept of expressions and explore how they are evaluated in a programming language. We'll learn about data types, type coercion, and common operators.

## 3.2 Precedence and Associativity

This section focuses on operator precedence and associativity. We'll discuss how certain operators have higher precedence than others and how parentheses can be used to control the order of evaluation.

## 3.3 Order of Evaluation

The order of evaluation is crucial in determining how different components within an expression are processed. We'll explain the default left-to-right evaluation, the use of parentheses for explicit order, and the importance of understanding how functions and function arguments are evaluated within expressions.

## 3.4 Short-Circuiting and Its Effects

Short-circuiting is a valuable concept in programming, and this section is dedicated to explaining it in detail. We'll explore how short-circuiting works with logical expressions, why it's important, and how it's implemented in Go. Real-world examples will help illustrate the concept.
