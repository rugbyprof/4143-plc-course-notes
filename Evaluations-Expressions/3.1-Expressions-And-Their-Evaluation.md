# Expressions and their Evaluation

An expression is any word or group of words or symbols that is a value. In programming, an expression is a value, or anything that executes and ends up being a value.
  Expressions are the building blocks of building highly functional and effective code. Without knowing what each individual piece of code (expressions)

### **Components of Expressions:**
**Values**: Expressions often include constants like numbers or strings, variables that hold values, and the results of other expressions.
Operators: These are symbols that represent operations, like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), equality (==), and logical AND (&&), among many others.
Function Calls: Expressions can involve calling functions or methods, which may return values to be used within the expression.

lets look at the 'expressions' of some basic Go code. 
```go
// All below headers are expressions at the core. Values, Operators, Function Calls

// Values
// 'x' ':=' '3'  each individual one is a piece to the 'expression'
x := 3
y := 4

// Operators
result := x + y

// Function Calls
import "math"

sqrtResult := math.Sqrt(25)

// Arithmetic Expression
arithmeticResult := 3 + 4*2

// Logical Expression
x := 6
y := 8
logicalResult := x > 5 && y < 10

// String Expression
str1 := "Hello, "
str2 := "world"
concatenatedString := str1 + str2

// Conditional Expression
x := 15
result := ""
if x > 10 {
    result = "Greater than 10"
} else {
    result = "Less than or equal to 10"
}

// Function Call Expression
import "math"
sqrtResult := math.Sqrt(25)

// Parentheses and Grouping
result := (3 + 4) * 2

// Short-Circuit Evaluation
a := true
b := false

if a && b {
    // This part is not reached because of short-circuiting.
}

// Type Conversion
x := 3
y := float64(x)

// Error Handling
x := 0
y := 2
result := y / x  // This would result in a runtime error (division by zero).
```

**Types of Expressions:**

**Arithmetic Expression:**

```go
result := 3 + 4*2
```

**Logical Expression:**

```go
x := 6
y := 8
logicalResult := x > 5 && y < 10
```

**String Expression:**

```go
str1 := "Hello, "
str2 := "world"
concatenatedString := str1 + str2
```

**Conditional Expression:**

```go
x := 15
result := ""
if x > 10 {
    result = "Greater than 10"
} else {
    result = "Less than or equal to 10"
}
```

**Function Call Expression:**

```go
import "math"
sqrtResult := math.Sqrt(25)
```

**Expression Evaluation:**

  Go follows the left-to-right order of evaluation for expressions.

**Operator Precedence and Associativity:**

  Go has a well-defined operator precedence. For example, in `result := 3 + 4*2`, the multiplication (*) has higher precedence, so it's evaluated before the addition (+).

**Order of Evaluation:**

  In Go, expressions are evaluated from left to right, but when there are multiple function calls, their order may vary.

**Short-Circuit Evaluation:**

  Go uses short-circuit evaluation in logical expressions. For example:

```go
a := true
b := false

// Short-circuiting occurs here, and 'b' is not evaluated.
if a && b {
    // ...
}
```

### **Parentheses and Grouping:**

Parentheses are used to group sub-expressions and explicitly specify the order of evaluation. For example, (3 + 4) * 2 ensures that the addition is performed first.

```go
result := (3 + 4) * 2
```

**Type Conversion:**
  In some cases, expressions may involve automatic type conversion (type coercion), where values are converted from one type to another to make an operation valid.
  Type conversion is explicit in Go. For example, converting an integer to a floating-point number would be a type conversion expression. 

```go
x := 3
y := float64(x)
```

**Complex Expressions:**

Complex expressions can involve combinations of values, operators, and function calls within a single expression.

```go
result := (3 + 4*2) - (7/3) + (10 % 4) == (6 * 2 - 1)
```

The result of this complex expression will be either `true` or `false`, depending on whether the left side of the expression 
is equal to the right side. Complex expressions like this one can be used in conditionals, assignments, and other parts of your 
Go code to perform various calculations and make decisions.

**Error Handling:**

Incorrect expressions in Go can lead to runtime errors. For example, division by zero:

```go
x := 0
y := 2
result := y / x // This will result in a runtime error (division by zero).
```

Error handling in Go is designed to be simple, explicit, and effective. It relies on returning error values from functions and checking those error values explicitly in the calling code. Here's an explanation of the key concepts and practices for error handling in Go:

### **Error as a Return Value:**
   - In Go, it's a convention to return errors as a second return value from functions that may produce errors. The first return value is usually the result of the operation.

   ```go
   func someFunction() (int, error) {
       // ...
       if err != nil {
           return 0, err
       }
       return result, nil
   }
   ```
### **Error Handling Check:**
   - The calling code should explicitly check the error value returned by functions and act accordingly. This promotes clear and intentional error handling.

   ```go
   result, err := someFunction()
   if err != nil {
       // Handle the error, e.g., log, return an error, or take appropriate action.
   }
   // Use the result.
   ```

### **Creating Custom Errors:**
   - It's common to create custom error types when returning errors from functions. Custom errors can include additional information to help identify the error's cause.

   ```go
   import "errors"
   
   func someFunction() (int, error) {
       if condition {
           return 0, errors.New("This is a custom error")
       }
       // ...
   }
   ```

### **Error Propagation:**
   - When writing higher-level functions that use lower-level functions, you often propagate errors up the call stack by returning the error.

   ```go
   func higherLevelFunction() error {
       result, err := someFunction()
       if err != nil {
           return err
       }
       // Continue processing and possibly return another error.
       return nil
   }
   ```

### **Defer and Clean-Up:**
   - Go provides the `defer` statement for clean-up actions. It is often used to ensure that resources are released, even in the presence of errors.

   ```go
   func someFunction() (int, error) {
       file, err := os.Open("file.txt")
       if err != nil {
           return 0, err
       }
       defer file.Close() // Ensures the file is closed, even in case of errors.
       // ...
   }
   ```

### **`errors` Package:**
   - The standard `errors` package in Go provides a simple way to create and work with errors. Custom errors can be created using `errors.New()` or by implementing the `error` interface.

   ```go
   import "errors"
   
   func someFunction() (int, error) {
       if condition {
           return 0, errors.New("This is a custom error")
       }
       // ...
   }
   ```

### **Panic and Recover (for Rare Cases):**
   - Go also supports panics and recover for handling severe and unrecoverable errors. Panics should be reserved for situations where the program cannot reasonably continue.

   ```go
   func someFunction() {
       if someCriticalErrorCondition {
           panic("This is a critical error")
       }
       // ...
   }
   
   func main() {
       defer func() {
           if r := recover(); r != nil {
               log.Println("Recovered from panic:", r)
           }
       }()
       someFunction()
   }
   ```

Go's error handling philosophy is based on simplicity, explicitness, and reliability. By returning errors as values, checking them explicitly, and using custom error types, Go encourages robust and maintainable error handling practices. Panics and recover should be used sparingly for exceptional cases where normal program execution cannot continue.
