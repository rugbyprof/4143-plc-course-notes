# Precedence and Associativity

**Precedence:**

- Precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before those with lower precedence.

- For example, in the expression `3 + 5 * 2`, the `*` operator has higher precedence than `+`, so it's evaluated first, and the result is `3 + (5 * 2) = 13`.

- You can introduce a table of common operators and their precedence levels, such as:
  - Arithmetic operators: `*` and `/` have higher precedence than `+` and `-`.
  - Comparison operators: `==` and `!=` have the same precedence, which is lower than `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=`.
  - Logical operators: `&&` has higher precedence than `||`.
  - Assignment operators: `=` has lower precedence than most other operators.

**Associativity:**

- Associativity comes into play when you have multiple operators with the same precedence in an expression. It determines the order of evaluation for operators of equal precedence.

- Operators can be left-associative or right-associative.
  
- **Left-associative**: Operators are evaluated from left to right. For example, in the expression `5 - 3 - 1`, the `-` operator is left-associative, so it's evaluated as `(5 - 3) - 1 = 1`.

- **Right-associative**: Operators are evaluated from right to left. Right-associative operators are less common, but an example is the exponentiation operator `^`. In the expression `2^3^2`, it's right-associative, so it's evaluated as `2^(3^2) = 2^9 = 512`.

- You can illustrate this concept with various examples and emphasize the importance of understanding both precedence and associativity when writing and debugging code.


**Precedence Example:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    result := 5 + 3*2
    fmt.Println(result) // Output: 11
}
```

In this example, the multiplication operator `*` has higher precedence than the addition operator `+`, so it's evaluated first. The result is `5 + (3 * 2)`, which equals 11.

**Associativity Example:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    result := 5 - 3 - 1
    fmt.Println(result) // Output: 1
}
```

In this example, the subtraction operator `-` is left-associative, meaning it's evaluated from left to right. So, the expression is evaluated as `(5 - 3) - 1`, resulting in 1.

**Parentheses Overriding Precedence:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    result := (5 + 3) * 2
    fmt.Println(result) // Output: 16
}
```

Here, the parentheses `(5 + 3)` force the addition to be evaluated before the multiplication. So, the result is `(8 * 2)`, which equals 16.

**Right-Associative:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    result := 2 ^ 3 ^ 2
    fmt.Println(result) // Output: 512
}
```

In this example, the `^` operator in Go is right-associative, so the expression is evaluated as `2 ^ (3 ^ 2)`, which results in 512. This is an example of right-associative behavior.
