# Names, Identifiers, Keywords

Names are user-defined labels or identifiers used to represent various program elements, such as variables, functions, classes, and modules.

Identifiers are a subset of names, specifically those used to name variables, functions, classes, and other entities in a programming language.

Keywords (also known as reserved words) are words that have special meanings in a programming language. These words are part of the language's syntax and are reserved for specific purposes.

Now that we have defined the meaning of each lets discuss some examples. 

let's delve specifically into names and identifiers:

**Names**:

- **Names** are labels or symbols used to refer to various elements in a program, such as variables, functions, constants, classes, and modules.
- Names are chosen by programmers to provide meaningful and descriptive representations of these program elements.
- Names serve to make the code more human-readable and understandable.
- Names can be comprised of letters, digits, and underscores, following specific rules and conventions defined by the programming language.
- Good naming practices help improve code clarity and maintainability.

**Identifiers**:

- **Identifiers** are a subset of names specifically used to name variables, functions, and other entities in a programming language.
- Identifiers have stricter rules and conventions than general names, and they are subject to the following common rules in many programming languages:
  - Must start with a letter (a-z or A-Z) or an underscore `_`.
  - Can be followed by letters, digits, or underscores.
  - Typically, identifiers are case-sensitive in most programming languages, meaning that `variableName` and `variablename` are treated as distinct identifiers.
  - Should not use spaces or special characters (e.g., @, $) in the identifier.


  Here are some examples of names and identifiers in golang:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Names
    userName := "John"
    result := calculateArea(5, 10)
    const maxValue = 100

    // Identifiers
    name := "Alice"
    areaResult := calculateArea(3, 7)
    userInput := "Hello"

    fmt.Println("User Name:", userName)
    fmt.Println("Result:", result)
    fmt.Println("Max Value:", maxValue)
    fmt.Println("Name:", name)
    fmt.Println("Area Result:", areaResult)
    fmt.Println("User Input:", userInput)
}

func calculateArea(length, width int) int {
    return length * width
}

```

As you can see above, identifiers and names are essentially the same thing. Developers use names to 'name' identifiers for specific variable, objects, functions in the program. But what happens when we try to name a variable a word thats reserved by the language as 'special' like for or while? This would be a 'keyword' which we briefly went over in the beginning. But what does this entail? What happens? It simply won't let you. Let's look at it with some examples of trying to use keywords as identifiers. 

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// This is not allowed, and it will result in a compilation error.
// Attempting to use a keyword as an identifier, in this case, "func," is not allowed.
func main() {
    func := "This is not allowed"
    fmt.Println(func)
}
```
Some of us may have tested this out and already came to the realization that it doesn't work, but why does it not work? Because keywords take precedence over identifiers. Keywords are the building blocks of languages, let's look at some of the ways keywords are extrememely important. 

  **Syntax**: Keywords define the language's syntax, ensuring code structure adheres to language rules.

  **Predefined Behavior**: They provide predefined behavior for language constructs and operations.

  **Consistency**: Keywords maintain uniformity in code, aiding readability and predictability.

  **Error Prevention**: Using keywords as identifiers is disallowed, preventing common coding errors.

  **Clarity**: Keywords make code more readable and express the programmer's intent.

  **Learning**: They are crucial for understanding and learning a programming language.

  **Tooling and IDE Support**: Keywords enable code analysis and IDE features, aiding development.

  **Interoperability**: In some cases, they facilitate communication between languages or components.

  **Documentation**: Keywords play a central role in language documentation and tutorials.


### When working with programming languages, it's important to distinguish between names, identifiers, and keywords:

- **Names** are user-defined labels used to represent various program elements, making code more readable and understandable.

- **Identifiers** are a subset of names and are used to name variables, functions, and other language entities. They follow language-specific rules and conventions.

- **Keywords** are reserved words with predefined meanings in a programming language. They play a fundamental role in defining the language's syntax and behavior, ensuring consistency, preventing errors, and aiding code readability and predictability.

Understanding the differences and proper use of names, identifiers, and keywords is essential for effective and error-free coding, as well as for learning and mastering a programming language.
