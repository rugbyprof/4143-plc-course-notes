# Chapter 2: Names, Binding, and Scope

This chapter explores the fundamental concepts of names, binding, and scope in programming. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code. In this chapter, we delve into various aspects of how programming languages manage and resolve identifiers and their scope.

### 2.1: Names, Identifiers, and Keywords

This section discusses the basics of names, identifiers, and keywords in programming languages. We explore how names represent various entities in a program, the rules for creating valid identifiers, and the significance of keywords in the language.

### 2.2: Binding Time: Static, Dynamic

This section focuses on the concept of binding time, which refers to when a value or entity gets associated with a name. We explore the differences between static and dynamic binding and their implications for program execution.

### 2.3: Scope: Lexical vs. Dynamic Scoping

Scope is a fundamental concept in programming, and in this section, we discuss the two primary types of scoping: lexical and dynamic. We delve into the characteristics of each, their advantages, and their impact on variable resolution.

### 2.4: Nested Scopes and Scope Rules

In this section, we explore the concept of nested scopes, where one scope can be contained within another. We discuss the rules that govern variable resolution in nested scopes and how this impacts the behavior of programs.

### 2.5: Static Vs Dynamic Scoping

The final section of this chapter provides a comparative analysis of static and dynamic scoping. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each and how to choose the appropriate scoping strategy for different programming scenarios.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the core concepts related to names, binding, and scope in programming. This knowledge will be invaluable as you write, debug, and maintain your code in various programming languages.
