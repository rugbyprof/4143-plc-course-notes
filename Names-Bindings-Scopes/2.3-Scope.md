# Scope

**Scope** refers to the region or context in which a variable, function, or other identifier is defined and can be referenced. It defines the parts of the program where a particular identifier is accessible and where it can be used.

Here are some key points to understand about scope:

1. **Local Scope**: Variables and functions declared within a specific block, such as a function or a loop, have local scope. They are only accessible within that block. This is sometimes referred to as block scope.

2. **Global Scope**: Variables and functions declared at the outermost level of a program have global scope. They are accessible from anywhere in the program, including within functions.

3. **Enclosing Scope**: In some programming languages, a nested block can access variables from its containing or enclosing block. This concept is known as lexical scoping or closure. It allows for the inner block to "capture" and use variables from the outer block.

4. **Shadowing**: If a variable declared in an inner scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope, it can "shadow" the outer variable, making it temporarily inaccessible within the inner scope. This technique varies from language to language.

5. **Lifetime**: The scope of a variable also relates to its lifetime. A variable exists within its scope, and it is typically destroyed when it goes out of scope. Allowing for functions to be less costly to the overall memory usage of the program. 

The concept of scope is crucial for understanding variable visibility, avoiding naming conflicts, and organizing code. It allows developers to control the accessibility and lifespan of variables and functions within their programs.

We now have decent oversight on what scope is and what terms pop up when discussing scope, so let's look at some examples of how scope affects a programs execution. 
  
### Local and Global scope
```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Global variable with global scope
var globalVar = 10

func main() {
    // Local variable with local scope
    var localVar = 5

    fmt.Println(globalVar) // Accessing globalVar
    fmt.Println(localVar)  // Accessing localVar

    anotherFunction()
}

func anotherFunction() {
    // Accessing globalVar from another function
    fmt.Println(globalVar)

    // Attempting to access localVar here would result in a compilation error
}
```
  
### Shadowing in Go
```go
package main

import "fmt"

var x = 10 // Global variable x

func main() {
    x := 5 // Local variable x, shadowing the global x

    // The local x shadows the global x within this block.
    fmt.Println(x) // Prints 5
}

func anotherFunction() {
    // Attempting to access the local x here would result in a compilation error
}

func yetAnotherFunction() {
    // Accessing the global x here
    fmt.Println(x) // Prints 10
}
```

### **Scope**


- **Local Scope**: Variables or functions declared within a specific block, like a function, have local scope and are only accessible within that block. This provides encapsulation and prevents naming conflicts.

- **Global Scope**: Variables or functions declared at the top level of a program have global scope, making them accessible from anywhere in the program. This allows for a wider scope of access.

Understanding and managing scope is crucial for maintaining well-structured and organized code, avoiding conflicts, and ensuring that variables and functions are used in the appropriate parts of the program. Now let's look at some more advanced scoping techniques.
