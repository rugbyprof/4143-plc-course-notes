# Static Vs Dynamic Scoping

Static scoping is exactly what we have been going over in the past couple of sections. It the the most common form of scoping and is present in all modern languages. Since we already know what static scoping is, let's look at dynamic scoping.

With dynamic scope, a global identifier refers to the identifier associated with the most recent environment and is uncommon in modern languages. In technical terms, this means that each identifier has a global stack of bindings and the occurrence of an identifier is searched in the most recent binding. 
In simpler terms, in dynamic scoping, the compiler first searches the current block and then successively all the calling functions. Let's look at an example

```c
// Since dynamic scoping is very uncommon in 
// the familiar languages, we consider the 
// following pseudo code as our example. It
// prints 20 in a language that uses dynamic
// scoping.   
 
int x = 10;
 
// Called by g()
int f()
{
   return x;
}
 
// g() has its own variable
// named as x and calls f()
int g()
{
   int x = 20;
   return f();
}
 
main()
{
  printf(g());
}
```
output: 20

  Dynamic scoping is a scoping mechanism in which the scope of a variable is determined by the call stack at runtime. Variables are bound to the most recent or dynamically calling function. This means that the scope of a variable can change dynamically as functions are called and returned.

  Dynamic scoping is maybe harder to grasp because it is not in any of our more modern languages. Static scoping is what we as programmers in the modern age know and use daily. Now that we know the concept of static and dynamic scoping, let's match them up and look at the key difference in their implementation. 

### **Static Scoping (Lexical Scoping):**

1. **Binding Time**: Static scoping binds variables to their respective scopes at compile time.

2. **Determination**: The scope of a variable is determined by its location in the source code (the lexical structure). It is fixed and known at compile time.

3. **Predictability**: Static scoping provides high predictability and readability, as variable references are resolved based on their context in the source code.

4. **Encapsulation**: It enforces encapsulation and information hiding, as variables are only accessible within their defined scopes.

5. **Examples**: Commonly used in modern programming languages, including Go, Python, Java, and many others.

### **Dynamic Scoping:**

1. **Binding Time**: Dynamic scoping binds variables to their respective scopes at runtime.

2. **Determination**: The scope of a variable is determined by the calling context at runtime. It can change dynamically as functions are called and returned.

3. **Flexibility**: Dynamic scoping allows for more flexible variable resolution but can lead to less predictable and more error-prone code.

4. **Surprising Behavior**: It can result in unexpected behavior, as the scope of a variable depends on the runtime call stack.

5. **Examples**: Historically used in some older programming languages like LISP and APL, but is less common in modern languages due to its complexity and potential for errors.

**Key Considerations**:

- Static scoping is the default and more widely used scoping mechanism in modern programming languages.
- Dynamic scoping is less common and is often discouraged due to its potential for creating code that is harder to understand, debug, and maintain.
- Dynamic scoping may provide more flexibility in some cases, but it can lead to unintended and hard-to-predict behavior, making code less robust. Static scoping, on the other hand, offers greater predictability and reliability.
