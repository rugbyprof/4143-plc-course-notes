# Nested Scope

Nested scope, also known as lexical scoping or block scope, is a concept in programming where one scope is contained within another. In a nested scope, variables and functions declared in the inner scope can access variables from the outer scope. This concept is essential for understanding how variables are resolved when there are multiple levels of nested scopes. You could in theory scope infinitely withing other scopes. 

  With this concept, examples work best. So let's dive in...  
  
### Function with nested scope, or a function inside of a function.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func outerFunction() {
    outerVar := 10 // Variable in the outer function's scope

    innerFunction := func() { // beginning of nested scope
        innerVar := 5 // Variable in the inner function's scope
        fmt.Println("Inner Var:", innerVar)
    }

    innerFunction()

    fmt.Println("Outer Var:", outerVar)
}

func main() {
    outerFunction()
}
```

### Triple nested for loop 
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
        // can not access j or k here
        // Outer loop (i)
        for j := 1; j <= 3; j++ {
            // can not access k here, can access i
            // Middle loop (j)
            for k := 1; k <= 3; k++ {
                // can access i, j or k
                // Inner loop (k)
                fmt.Printf("i=%d, j=%d, k=%d\n", i, j, k)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Though you should try to avoid nesting if statements past two (unless necessary), here is an example of this. 
### Triple nested if statement
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    age := 25
    hasLicense := true
    isCitizen := true

    if age >= 18 {
        // Outer if statement (age)
        fmt.Println("You are of legal age.")
        
        if hasLicense {
            // Middle if statement (hasLicense)
            fmt.Println("You have a valid driver's license.")
            
            if isCitizen {
                // Inner if statement (isCitizen)
                fmt.Println("You are a citizen. You can drive legally.")
            } else {
                fmt.Println("You are not a citizen, but you have a valid license.")
            }
        } else {
            fmt.Println("You don't have a valid driver's license.")
        }
    } else {
        fmt.Println("You are not of legal age to drive.")
    }
}

```

### Key Takeaways of Nested Scope:

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Nested scope creates a hierarchical structure in which one scope is contained within another. Inner scopes have access to variables from outer scopes.

2. **Variable Resolution**: Variables are resolved within the closest containing scope. If a variable is not found in the inner scope, the program looks in the next outer scope until the variable is found or all scopes are checked.

3. **Shadowing**: In nested scope, variables in inner scopes can have the same names as variables in outer scopes, effectively "shadowing" the outer variables temporarily.

4. **Enclosing Scope**: The outer scope containing an inner scope is often referred to as the enclosing scope. Variables from the enclosing scope can be accessed by the inner scope, but not vice versa.

5. **Function Scopes**: Functions and methods create nested scopes. Variables declared within a function are in the scope of that function, and they can access variables from enclosing scopes, such as global variables.

6. **Lexical Scoping**: Many programming languages, including Go, use lexical scoping, where variable names are resolved based on their location in the source code (the lexical structure) rather than their runtime context.

7. **Closures**: Nested scope is crucial for closures. A closure captures variables from the enclosing scope, allowing them to persist even after the outer function has completed its execution.

8. **Encapsulation**: Nested scope helps in encapsulating variables and functions within their appropriate contexts, reducing naming conflicts and improving code organization.

  Understanding nested scope is essential for proper variable management, maintaining clean and organized code, and leveraging powerful features like closures in programming languages. It provides a way to control variable visibility and accessibility within different parts of a program.
