The terms "first-class function" and "higher-order function" are related but refer to different concepts:

1. **First-Class Function**: A language feature or property where functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions. In a programming language with first-class functions, functions are treated no differently from other data types (such as integers or strings). They can be manipulated, stored in data structures, and used as values. First-class functions enable powerful programming paradigms such as functional programming.

2. **Higher-Order Function**: A higher-order function is a function that either takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result. In other words, a higher-order function operates on functions, treating them as parameters or return values. Higher-order functions allow for increased abstraction and flexibility in programming. They enable the composition of functions, the creation of reusable code patterns, and the implementation of advanced programming techniques such as function currying and partial application.

To summarize, the main difference is that "first-class function" refers to the property of treating functions as first-class citizens, allowing them to be assigned to variables and used like any other value. On the other hand, "higher-order function" is a specific type of function that takes functions as arguments or returns functions as results, enabling the manipulation and composition of functions within a program. A language can have first-class functions without necessarily supporting higher-order functions, but if a language supports higher-order functions, it implies that functions are treated as first-class entities.
