1. **[Not OOP](not_oop.md)**: Start with a brief introduction to Go's approach to object-oriented programming (OOP) or rather, its preference for composition over inheritance. Explain why Go doesn't have traditional classes and inheritance.

2. **[New Keyword](new_keyword.md)**: Explain the use of the `new` keyword in Go for dynamic memory allocation.

2. **[Slices of Structs](slices_of_structs.md)**: Discuss the use of slices of structs for managing collections of structured data.

3. **[Maps](maps.md)**: Introduce maps as a way to create key-value associations in Go.

4. **[Struct vs. Interface](struct_vs_interface.md)**: Introduce structs as the basic building blocks for data and explain interfaces as a way to define behavior. This sets the stage for understanding Go's type system.

5. **[Methods vs. Functions](methods_vs_functions.md)**: Explore the distinction between methods and functions in Go and how methods are associated with types (structs).

4. **[First-Class Functions](first_class_func.md)**: Discuss the concept of first-class functions in Go and how functions can be treated as values, covering anonymous functions and user-defined function types.

5. **[Interfaces](interfaces.md)**: Go deeper into interfaces, covering interface declaration, implementation, and polymorphism.
   
6. **[Interfaces and Inheritance](interfaces_and_inheritance.md)**: Finally, discuss how Go achieves polymorphism through interfaces and compare it to traditional inheritance.

7. **[Composition Over Inheritance](comp_over_inherit.md)**: Reinforce the idea of composition over inheritance, showing how to embed structs within other structs and use composition to build complex types.

10. **[Concurrency](./concurrency/)**: Introduce concurrency in Go, discussing goroutines and channels, as it's a significant aspect of Go.

11. **[Closures]()**: Explore closures and how they capture variables from their surrounding lexical scope.

12. **[Runes](runes.md)**: Explain what runes are in Go, their significance in handling Unicode characters, and their use in text processing.

13. **[Defer](defer.md)**: Discuss the `defer` keyword in Go and its role in managing resource cleanup and deferred function calls.
